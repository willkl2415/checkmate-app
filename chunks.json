It generally includes an analysis of different training Methods and technologies, with a view to recommending the optimum training solution which balances cost and quality. It is a highly flexible procedure with the choice of supporting tools and techniques to suit different Training Systems. In all cases, however, a TNA is an output based, iterative process that provides an audit trail for all decisions and is closely mapped to the requirements of the QMS. A TNA does not, and should not, imply that training will be the only solution. If training is not the solution, this will become apparent in the Scoping Exercise, after which, analysis activity will cease."

It is therefore important that at every stage of a TNA, the key outputs are reviewed to ensure their continuing validity, and that stages of the process be repeated if necessary. Processes for reviewing the TNA outputs should be capable of amendment where changes are required. Tight control should be exercised by the TNASG, which approves all changes to the TNA.

This is articulated in the Scoping Exercise Report. The scoping exercise should be completed as early as possible and starts by acquiring as much relevant information as possible about the training need and the Customer requirement. It defines the TNA management, risk, programming and resourcing within the boundaries of policy, assumptions and constraints. It also highlights issues that impact upon, or will need to be considered, during Stage 2. It will advise the TNA strategy for the proposed training solution and provide the parameters of the new or changed Defence requirement where TNAs will be, or have been, carried out. The scoping exercise does not have to be a long and protracted document and can utilise electronic references such as minutes of meetings, records of conversations to provide an auditable trail."

As this investigation progresses, decisions about how to apply the DSAT process should be made. For example, is it necessary to complete a full Role Analysis (RA) from first principles, or is it sufficient to confirm that an existing Role PS / Framework is still valid? Likewise, the strategy may recommend the process focuses on certain elements of a Role/task Performance which need further development or perhaps recommends targeting the TOs to ensure they support a Role PS and/or Framework. It may be decided that the sequence of training be reviewed if this is highlighted as a potential problem or that further consideration is given to current refresher training intervals.

Therefore, it can be argued that jobs (in the traditional sense of a person conducting a single task requiring a single skill, for example) seldom exist. Accordingly, it is more appropriate to analyse a Role that a person will fulfil. An example would be a RN Catering Services rating, who is trained in the primary Role but routinely has other Roles and duties aboard ship that are not related to the primary role (such as firefighting and First Aid). Training that person for the job of Catering Services/Fire Fighter/First Aider is impractical, but training that person for the primary Role , then the Role of fire fighter and the First Aider makes more sense. Thus RA is a more logical term than Job Analysis and more reflective of what this analysis actually does."

These skills are learned in connection with common activities such as using a computer, driving a car or playing a musical instrument. Many tasks performed in Defence can be categorised as having a large physical component, e.g. stripping and assembling a weapon (discrete), flying an aircraft (continuous) and tying a bowline (discrete). Complex physical skills can often be broken down into smaller sub-skills, which can be learned separately and then put together for total performance. An example of this is swimming, which has 3 sub-skills (arm action, leg action and breathing technique), which can be learned and practised separately and then performed as one. More complex skills such as flying/driving, are similarly broken down into their component parts and taught as discrete skills in discrete lessons."

The identification of Standards relating to personal qualities and Attitudes is perhaps the most challenging part of the KSA Analysis. This is because Attitudes cannot always be observed directly and hence the creation of definable standards can prove difficult. Attitude is defined as a predisposition resulting in a tendency to act or react in a certain manner when confronted with another person, group, object, situation or idea. It is important to understand that this predisposition to think and feel in a certain way does not necessarily result in observable behaviours. An example of this could be an individual who holds an Attitude that all dogs are dangerous. However, this attitude may not be obvious to others when the individual is handling a dog with which they are familiar and have learned is friendly.

A Behaviourally Anchored Rating Scale (BARS) is an example of a tool which can be used to assess observable behaviour objectively. Although a BARS (Table 3) can be used to measure attitude indirectly through observing behaviour, much care is needed when inferring Attitudes from observable behaviours alone. Attitudes may also be directly measured using validated questionnaires or other psychometric instruments21. Some examples are presented in Table 3. Note that whilst BARS is predominantly a tool used in the training environment, forming part of the ASpec if appropriate, it is mentioned here because it is useful to bear it in mind at the RA stage."

Selection, development (including education) and training have key roles in growing necessary competencies and competences. Therefore, effective human capability development should not neglect either; instead, consideration of both will result in optimal requirement setting and solution development. Competence development (in the form of a Role PS and associated training solutions) is covered under the DSAT training analysis process contained within this policy. Furthermore, DSAT derived training solutions may either require some competencies as a pre-requisite or be developed during a training solution (often at the EO level)."

This has the added benefit of easing the accreditation process and aiding skills transfer from both within Defence and externally (particularly during transition to civilian life).

For example, constraints on training resources and the availability of real equipment for training may force the emphasis towards workplace training. The same would be true if it is not possible to replicate critical Role PS Conditions in training establishments or via distributed training. Alternatively expensive and scarce training equipment or qualified trainers may only be available in [some] training establishments. It is therefore important to determine an estimate of where the balance between training to be delivered in a training establishment and workplace training will fall. It is based on a careful analysis of exactly what the TRA requires, tempered by that which is deliverable and can only be achieved by consultation with the TRA and the Training Provider, who will have knowledge of existing training and current training facilities and resources. This will later result in the allocation of TOs to a TPS, WTS, or, where no training will take place, the Performance, Conditions and Standards to a RTGS32. The output from this work could be an amendment to the Initial Training Categories or recommendations that take account of both DIF Analysis results and the impact of all other Role, training and resource factors."

This will suggest the appropriate choice of Method (e.g. a Skills-based EO must have some element of practice involved in the Method; whilst role-play is an example of a training Method suitable for a Behaviour-based EO). The aim must be to choose a Method that is compatible with the material to be learned. Learning a physical Skill may require equipment and machinery and a low trainee-to-trainer ratio as it tends to be trainee-centric. Knowledge learning is most effective and efficient via e-learning, in the form of a lecture, or with links to information.

    "heading": "Purpose and Application.  The purpose of Robust Training is to progressively develop a Service Person’s (SPs) resilience to enable them to perform effectively in any operational environment.  The degree to which Robust Training is employed within an Initial training programme should reflect the employment of that SP in both specialist and generic tasks.  Emphasis should be placed upon the need for SP to perform in the most demanding conditions in which they may realistically expect to find themselves if deployed to high-tempo and/or high-threat operational environments.  As Defence transitions to a contingent posture, the non-linear nature of the Contemporary Operating Environment (COE) will inevitably expose SP from support functions to higher risks than would have traditionally been the case.  It is therefore no longer acceptable to have a situation where combat personnel and support or service support personnel sit at distant ends of a wide spectrum of individual resilience.  This gap should be narrowed if all SP are to be best prepared for operational service.  This requires moral courage to implement and there is a need for a coherence of approach across Defence and single Service (sS) training establishments to ensure that Robust Training is systematic, progressive and appropriately contextualised.",

If all SP are to be best prepared for operational service, training needs to focus on the increased resilience end of the spectrum and where possible enhance the psychological stressors in training (e.g. increased use of battle simulation, additional night training scenarios) and the physical stressors (e.g. extending training days, more time living ‘in the field’ or austere simulated operational conditions)."

It must be proportionate to the delivery of the defined operational output.

These factors are not mutually opposing or irreconcilable.  Robust Training can be delivered during all phases of training whilst successfully discharging Defence’s welfare and Duty of Care responsibilities.  The risks associated with Robust Training must be identified, assessed and addressed with a view to enabling this important element of training.  A culture of risk aversion must be avoided as it merely transfers risk to the Commands and is morally unjustifiable.  It is incumbent upon Commanders, their staff and trainers to be conversant with the principles and application of risk assessment at their respective levels of training command.  Intelligent risk management must be led by the Commander and understood by all staff involved in training delivery.  The first step in developing risk management locally will be through the CRA/SCD process.  Detailed briefing on local procedures must be included in staff/trainer induction training and understanding must be developed further through regular study periods"
