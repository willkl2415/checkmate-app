It generally includes an analysis of different training Methods and technologies, with a view to recommending the optimum training solution which balances cost and quality. It is a highly flexible procedure with the choice of supporting tools and techniques to suit different Training Systems. In all cases, however, a TNA is an output based, iterative process that provides an audit trail for all decisions and is closely mapped to the requirements of the QMS. A TNA does not, and should not, imply that training will be the only solution. If training is not the solution, this will become apparent in the Scoping Exercise, after which, analysis activity will cease."

Many influencing factors, risks and assumptions are liable to change during the conduct of a TNA. It is therefore important that at every stage of a TNA, the key outputs are reviewed to ensure their continuing validity, and that stages of the process be repeated if necessary. Processes for reviewing the TNA outputs should be capable of amendment where changes are required. Tight control should be exercised by the TNASG, which approves all changes to the TNA. Follow-on changes to the training requirement and the impact on training may be managed through a system of configuration control but this does not remove the responsibility of the TNASG for ensuring that changes are reflected in the TNA."

It will advise the TNA strategy for the proposed training solution and provide the parameters of the new or changed Defence requirement where TNAs will be, or have been, carried out.

Likewise, the strategy may recommend the process focuses on certain elements of a Role/task Performance which need further development or perhaps recommends targeting the TOs to ensure they support a Role PS and/or Framework. It may be decided that the sequence of training be reviewed if this is highlighted as a potential problem or that further consideration is given to current refresher training intervals.

Further constraints are the timing/development of the TNA, accessibility to SMEs and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). The TNA may be directed to examine a particular potential training solution, however, without prejudicing the final outcome. Constraints may also be identified in strategic trends, doctrine, concept documents (e.g. the Concept of Employment for a capability) or can be determined through contextual analysis (such as via PESTLE7 or other frameworks).

The outputs from the scoping exercise and subsequent analyses should be agreed during Stage 1 of the TNA, which will allow the user to select the correct methodology and tools based on the constraints and information available at the time.

These skills are learned in connection with common activities such as using a computer, driving a car or playing a musical instrument. Many tasks performed in Defence can be categorised as having a large physical component, e.g. stripping and assembling a weapon (discrete), flying an aircraft (continuous) and tying a bowline (discrete). Complex physical skills can often be broken down into smaller sub-skills, which can be learned separately and then put together for total performance. An example of this is swimming, which has 3 sub-skills (arm action, leg action and breathing technique), which can be learned and practised separately and then performed as one. More complex skills such as flying/driving, are similarly broken down into their component parts and taught as discrete skills in discrete lessons."

The identification of Standards relating to personal qualities and Attitudes is perhaps the most challenging part of the KSA Analysis. This is because Attitudes cannot always be observed directly and hence the creation of definable standards can prove difficult. Attitude is defined as a predisposition resulting in a tendency to act or react in a certain manner when confronted with another person, group, object, situation or idea. It is important to understand that this predisposition to think and feel in a certain way does not necessarily result in observable behaviours. An example of this could be an individual who holds an Attitude that all dogs are dangerous. However, this attitude may not be obvious to others when the individual is handling a dog with which they are familiar and have learned is friendly.

To assist subjective judgements on attitude an objective criteria should, where possible, be used to support the decision. Defining the negative, what is unacceptable behaviour, can result in a simpler and more precise Standard. A Behaviourally Anchored Rating Scale (BARS) is an example of a tool which can be used to assess observable behaviour objectively. Although a BARS (Table 3) can be used to measure attitude indirectly through observing behaviour, much care is needed when inferring Attitudes from observable behaviours alone. Attitudes may also be directly measured using validated questionnaires or other psychometric instruments21. Some examples are presented in Table 3. Note that whilst BARS is predominantly a tool used in the training environment, forming part of the ASpec if appropriate, it is mentioned here because it is useful to bear it in mind at the RA stage."

This analysis should be conducted as a result of the production of a Role PS derived from the RA and include any existing Training Performance Standards. Fidelity Analysis considers each relevant Performance objective in the Role PS to assess the extent to which the training environment should replicate the workplace (real) environment to enable training to be effective. Decisions made at this stage can have a significant impact on the nature and cost of training solutions, as fidelity can be a significant cost driver, so it is important not to ‘gold plate’ the fidelity requirements, but instead determine the appropriate level of fidelity that is essential to achieve the desired training effect.

For example, constraints on training resources and the availability of real equipment for training may force the emphasis towards workplace training. The same would be true if it is not possible to replicate critical Role PS Conditions in training establishments or via distributed training. Alternatively expensive and scarce training equipment or qualified trainers may only be available in [some] training establishments. It is therefore important to determine an estimate of where the balance between training to be delivered in a training establishment and workplace training will fall. It is based on a careful analysis of exactly what the TRA requires, tempered by that which is deliverable and can only be achieved by consultation with the TRA and the Training Provider, who will have knowledge of existing training and current training facilities and resources. This will later result in the allocation of TOs to a TPS, WTS, or, where no training will take place, the Performance, Conditions and Standards to a RTGS32. The output from this work could be an amendment to the Initial Training Categories or recommendations that take account of both DIF Analysis results and the impact of all other Role, training and resource factors."

Each EO must be examined to determine whether it is primarily expressed as a KSA. This will suggest the appropriate choice of Method (e.g. a Skills-based EO must have some element of practice involved in the Method; whilst role-play is an example of a training Method suitable for a Behaviour-based EO). The aim must be to choose a Method that is compatible with the material to be learned. Learning a physical Skill may require equipment and machinery and a low trainee-to-trainer ratio as it tends to be trainee-centric. Knowledge learning is most effective and efficient via e-learning, in the form of a lecture, or with links to information. This works best in a flipped classroom, where learning is then consolidated through discussion."

A learner-focused approach aids information retention by considering the needs of the trainees and increasing their involvement in the learning process. A trainer-focused approach, whilst increasing trainee-to-trainer ratios, is not as effective for aiding trainee retention.

    "content": "In accordance with Defence and HM Treasury guidelines, an examination of the broad order costs of various options to recommend the most cost-effective training solution must be undertaken. It is important that costing and investment appraisal are undertaken strictly in accordance with the current Defence and Service or Strategic Command policies and conventions. If training specialists become involved with costing or investment appraisal, they should obtain current advice from the TNASG or other authoritative body. CBA activity does not start at this stage of the TNA but the result of it is included in the Training Needs Report hence its inclusion here. Like many aspects of DSAT, CBA is an iterative process with initial activity commencing much earlier in the TNA process, as appropriate. The CBA will likely be further refined during the Method & Media selection process in Element 2 (Design). An estimate of the financial risks and/or opportunities associated with each training solution option should be undertaken. Training staffs are unlikely to be qualified to conduct financial risk analysis at anything other than a superficial level33. However, these analyses will be a significant factor in selecting training solution options."

The TRA is often a nominated post at 2* level but it is common practice for TRA responsibilities to be delegated, by letter, to an individual (or organisation) who has more knowledge of the specific requirement."

If all SP are to be best prepared for operational service, training needs to focus on the increased resilience end of the spectrum and where possible enhance the psychological stressors in training (e.g. increased use of battle simulation, additional night training scenarios) and the physical stressors (e.g. extending training days, more time living ‘in the field’ or austere simulated operational conditions)."

It must be proportionate to the delivery of the defined operational output.

These factors are not mutually opposing or irreconcilable.  Robust Training can be delivered during all phases of training whilst successfully discharging Defence’s welfare and Duty of Care responsibilities.  The risks associated with Robust Training must be identified, assessed and addressed with a view to enabling this important element of training.  A culture of risk aversion must be avoided as it merely transfers risk to the Commands and is morally unjustifiable.  It is incumbent upon Commanders, their staff and trainers to be conversant with the principles and application of risk assessment at their respective levels of training command.  Intelligent risk management must be led by the Commander and understood by all staff involved in training delivery.  The first step in developing risk management locally will be through the CRA/SCD process.  Detailed briefing on local procedures must be included in staff/trainer induction training and understanding must be developed further through regular study periods"
